- Add support for scheduling events in the future, this does not
  work with the current setup because... reasons. This actually works
  but we can't revise events in the future, which could be problematic.
- Temporarily use a single processor, or only a single processor,
  do multi-processor management in UI later
- Refactor!
- Fix restart bugs, all components have to be able to fail and start again.
- Pimp that GUI
- Document ALL THE THINGS
- Make a flashy website? A video demo?
- Make it super easy to deploy, run-of-the-mill "webmaster" level!
